    <h2>Features & Service Description</h2>
    <p class="tos-section-text">
      Splitly provides tools to help friends, roommates, and travelers manage shared expenses
      easily. Some of the features include:
    </p>

    <ul class="tos-list">
      <li>Bill splitting tools for accurate expense division</li>
      <li>Group expense tracking to monitor shared costs</li>
      <li>Balance calculation features to see who owes what</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tos-section-text">
      We are always improving and updating Splitly. Features may change over time
      to provide a better experience for our users.
    </p>

  </div>

<section class="tos-section">
  <div class="tos-section-inner">

    <h2>Payments & Premium Features</h2>
    <p class="tos-section-text">
      Splitly is free to use, and all core features, such as bill splitting, group expense tracking, 
      and balance calculations, are available at no cost. We may introduce premium features in 
      the future to provide advanced functionality or additional convenience. Any premium services 
      will have clear pricing, and users can choose whether to subscribe or purchase them.
    </p>

    <p class="tos-section-text">
      Pricing and plans for premium features may change over time, as we continuously improve 
      the app and add new tools. If you subscribe to a paid service, you are responsible for 
      keeping your payment information up to date. Please note that, unless explicitly stated, 
      we do not offer refunds for payments already made.
    </p>

    <p class="tos-section-text">
      Including this section now helps us future-proof Splitly. Even if you only offer free features 
      today, it sets clear expectations for users if we introduce paid services later, reducing confusion 
      and protecting both your platform and your users.
